# Tachyon Physics Simulation

A lightweight C++ physics engine built from scratch, based on concepts from Ian Millington’s *Game Physics Engine Development*.  
This project demonstrates early-stage physics simulations including rigid body dynamics, collision resolution, and particle systems.

---

## ✨ Features

- Rigid body dynamics (initial flying box)
- Particle collisions (broad phase + narrow phase)
- Spring-damped particle systems
- Gravity, damping, pairwise collision resolution
- GLFW and OpenGL visualization
- ImGui GUI integration (WIP)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have the dependencies installed (below).
2. Use the batch files:
   - `run_main2.bat` → Runs the collision particle visualizer
   - `run_main3.bat` → Runs the spring, constraint, and force demonstrations
3. Batch files automatically compile and launch the simulations.

- **GLFW 3.4** (precompiled binaries)
- **OpenGL** (system provided)
- **ImGui** (included in `/external/imgui`)
- **Windows OS** (batch file setup)

# 📂 Simulations

## 🛩️ Flying Dutchman — Rigid Body Flying Box

An early rigid-body simulation where a single box "flies" using simple force and torque modeling.  
Inspired by Ian Millington’s flight simulator example.
